HSH-CLC:

ABSTRACT:
hshclc is an hash calculator, it support md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512.

USE:
	COMMAND LINE:
You can calculate a single hash by command line with this sintax:
hshclc -i <input_file> -a <algorithm: md5|sha1|sha224|...> -o [<output_file> [--tee]]

	CONFIGURATION FILE:
You can calculate and check multiple hashes on multiple files with a simple configuration file.
This is an example:

**********  config file: config.cfg  **********
-file <bar/foo1.ext> {
	-calculate md5 sha1 sha512;
	-check {
		md5	<md5_sum>;
		sha256	<sha256_sum>;
	}
	-tee <output_file>;
}
-file <foo2.ext> {
	-calculate sha256;
	-check {
		sha384	<sha384_sum>;
	}
	-out <output_file>;
}
**********  config file: config.clc  **********

and then:
hshclc -c config.clc

		NB:	
		you must use semicolon at the end of any line.
		With configuration file it will append to output file, if exists, else it will create the new file and then append.
				
For other informations use "hshclc --help" or "hshclc -h".
